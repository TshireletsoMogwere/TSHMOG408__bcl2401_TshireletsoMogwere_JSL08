# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

# Learning Experience README

## Introduction
   This README contains my learning experience in designing a singleton pattern that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Goals
   - To understand design pattern
   - To learn how to faciliate a global access
   - Learn how to promote code reusability

## Resources 
   - Youtube

## Learning Process
   I began by grasping the concept of the Singleton Pattern to understand its purpose and benefits. I also watched the video that was recomended for us to watch. I then bagan to practise to fully understand how it works.

## Achievements 
  - Created a singleton pattern by creating two instances (`branchA` and `branchB`) to show that they both point to the same instance,
    ensuring that there is only one set of branch information throughout the application.

  ## Challenges Faced
  - I did not face any challenges, the instructions were clear and easy to understand of what was required of me to do.

## Conclusion
   My learning experience was awesome. I successfully implemented a singleton pattern and fully understand how it works.
